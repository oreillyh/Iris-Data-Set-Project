## Exploration of the Iris Data set using Python
## PROJECT PLANNING:
  ### 1.0 INTRODUCTION
  #### 1.1 The Iris Data Set
   The iris data set was first described in a paper written by R.A. Fisher in the Annals of Human Genetics in 1936. It is a data set which the author gathered on three species of Irises: *setosa*, *versicolor* and *virginica*. Measurements of 4 characteristics of 50 flowers of each of the plants were taken, namely Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal Length, and Petal width  [The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems][http://rcs.chemometrics.ru/Tutorials/classification/Fisher.pdf]
