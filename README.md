## PROJECT PLANNING:
  ### 1.0 INTRODUCTION
  #### 1.1 The Iris Data Set
   The iris data set was first described in a paper written by R.A. Fisher in the *Annals of Human Genetics* in 1936. It is a data set which the author gathered on three species of Irises: *setosa*, *versicolor* and *virginica*. Measurements of 4 characteristics of 50 flowers of each of the plants were taken, namely Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal Length, and Petal width  [The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems][http://rcs.chemometrics.ru/Tutorials/classification/Fisher.pdf]
    
   #### 1.2 History and background to analysis of Fishers Iris Data Set

   #### 1.3 Simple Python functions
   #### 1.4 Python Packages
   #### 1.5 Literature Review
    
   ### 2.0 EXPERIMENTAL

   Work done on the data set

   #### 2.1 Downloading and importing the Data Set

   note to self: look up *csv* module in Python's standard library :+1:

   #### 2.2 Simple Python scripts
   #### 2.3 Simple Statistical Analysis
