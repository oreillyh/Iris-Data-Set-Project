## Exploration of the Iris Data set using Python
## python files in this repository
### Irisdata.py = a basic few lines of code to import csv file and sort into rows and column
### IrisData_np.py attempt to import pandas, numpy and matplotlib packages and work on data set
### Irisdata_mean.py is an initial attempt to write simple functions on irisdat set as csv file
## PROJECT PLANNING:
  ### 1.0 INTRODUCTION
  #### 1.1 The Iris Data Set
   The iris data set was first described in a paper written by R.A. Fisher in the *Annals of Human Genetics* in 1936. It is a data set which the author gathered on three species of Irises: *setosa*, *versicolor* and *virginica*. Measurements of 4 properties of 50 flowers of each of the plants were taken, namely Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal Length, and Petal width  [The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems][http://rcs.chemometrics.ru/Tutorials/classification/Fisher.pdf]
    
   #### 1.2 Background to Fishers Iris Data Set Analysis

   #### 1.3 Simple Python functions
   #### 1.4 Python Packages
   ##### Numpy

   The numPy package is a basic package for scientific computation in python. It is also particularly useful as a container for multidimensional data which makes NumPy arrays easy to work with,manipulate and analyse. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases. Ref [NumPy][https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/index.html]
   #### 1.5 Literature Review
    
   ### 2.0 EXPERIMENTAL

   Work done on the data set

   #### 2.1 Downloading and importing the Data Set

   note to self: look up *csv* module in Python's standard library :+1:

   #### 2.2 Simple Python scripts
   #### 2.3 Simple Statistical Analysis
  Some simple calculations on the data set might involve getting the mean of each column i.e. looping through column 1 to 4, getting the sum of each column and dividing by the number of rows to get the mean. This loop would have to terminate at the strings in the data set.

  The IrisData_mean.py file in this repository has been written using the NumPy package to carry out simple statistical analysis of the data set.

  The next step might be to calculate the mean of each property: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal Length, and Petal width for each species.

  Further work would be to calculate the standard deviation from the mean for each property
